ThroneAndLibertyBot

ThroneAndLibertyBot is a Python-based project designed to automate gameplay in Throne and Liberty using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning, specifically YOLO11. This bot simulates human-like interactions within the game, adhering to the game’s rules by avoiding any injections or modifications to the game client. Instead, it uses real-time object detection to understand game elements and make gameplay decisions.

Features

	•	Computer Vision with YOLO11: Trains the bot to recognize and interact with key game objects, NPCs, and enemies.
	•	Non-intrusive Automation: Operates without modifying game files, strictly simulating key presses and mouse movements.
	•	Dynamic Learning: Bot improves over time by analyzing gameplay patterns, optimizing its strategy for questing, combat, exploration, and resource gathering.
	•	Modular Design: Easily configurable for different gameplay goals, from quest completion to combat efficiency.

Goals

The main objective is to develop a fully autonomous bot that can progress from level 1 to level 50, complete quests, engage in combat, and navigate the game world. This project is built with a commitment to compliance with ethical gameplay standards and fair play policies.
